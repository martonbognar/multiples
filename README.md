# What is this?

Again a maths project by [@Nohcra](https://github.com/NohcRa) and me, this program demonstrates the multiples of integers in a coordinate system.

# Installation

1. Install a Pascal compiler (for example [Free Pascal](http://www.freepascal.org/)).
2. Compile `multiples.pas`
3. Run the created .exe file
